# TechWorkshop L300: AI Apps and Agents

This lab teaches you how to design and build AI applications and agents using Microsoft Foundry. You will learn how to create AI-powered applications that can interact with users, process natural language, and perform tasks based on user guidance. You will also learn how to monitor, troubleshoot, and perform red teaming activities against agents.

## Exercises

This lab has exercises on:

* Deploy and configure resources
* Implement a multimodal AI shopping assistant
* Extend the shopping assistant using the A2A Protocol
* Observe model utilization in Microsoft Foundry
* Agentic DevOps
* Red Teaming AI Agents
* Resource cleanup

The lab is available as GitHub pages [here](https://microsoft.github.io/TechWorkshop-L300-AI-Apps-and-agents/).

## Prerequisites

For running this lab you will need:

* An MCAPS subscription with access to Microsoft Foundry. External MCAPS subscriptions are preferred, though internal MCAPS subscriptions should work as well. Microsoft EMU accounts will not have sufficient privileges to perform all of the actions necessary.
* A desktop, laptop, or virtual machine and access to install software on that machine.
